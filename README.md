# Day-6-of-Learning-Java
In the day 6 I have learn about the MULTITHREADING and made the program with using THREADS on { Printing Even and Odd numbers , Multiplication of 2 and 3 tables, Printing characters A to E and F to J using Inheritance , Demonstrating Incrementing a counter }.

The problems are as following:-

Q1. Create two threads, one thread prints even numbers from 0 to 10, and the second thread prints odd numbers from 1 to 10. Use the Thread class (Inheritance method).

Q2. Create a thread to display the multiplication table of 2. Create another thread to display the multiplication table of 3. Use the Thread class for one and the Runnable interface for the other.

Q3. Create two threads:
• One thread prints characters from 'A' to 'E'.
• Second thread prints characters from 'F' to 'J'.
• Use the Thread class (Inheritance).

Q4. Implement a Java program with the class name SyncDemo to demonstrate incrementing a counter using multithreading. Create a Counter class with an increment method. In the main method, create a thread that increments the counter 1000 times. After the thread completes execution, print the final count.
